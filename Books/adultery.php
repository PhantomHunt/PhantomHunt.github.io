		 <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
          
		  <p>A woman around her thirties begins to question the routine and predictability of her days.
		  In everybody’s eyes, she has a perfect life: a solid and stable marriage to a rich and loving 
		  husband, sweet and well-behaved children and a job as a journalist she can't complain about.
		  However, she can no longer bear the necessary effort to fake happiness when all she feels in 
		  life is an enormous apathy, boredom and depression. All that changes when she encounters an 
		  ex-boyfriend from her adolescence. Jacob is now a successful politician and, during an interview, 
		  he ends up arousing something in her she hadn’t felt for a long time: passion. They begin an affair 
		  which leads to brutal, S/M sex that she finds very exciting. She will now do anything to conquer that
		  impossible love, and will have to go down to the pit of human emotions to finally find her redemption. </p>
